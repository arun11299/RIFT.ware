# This template has all supported TAGs.
# This template can be used as input to the xlate_cfg.py script as follows:

# python3 ./xlate_cfg.py -i ./rwconman_test_config_template.cfg -o ./rwconman_test_config.cfg -x "{1: {'test/cp1': '11.0.0.1'}, 2: {'test/cp1': '11.0.0.2'}, 'rw_mgmt_ip': '1.1.1.1', 'rw_username': 'admin', 'test/cp1': '11.0.0.3', 'rw_password': 'admin'}"

# Following are simple TAGs
1. This is Management IP: <rw_mgmt_ip>
2. This is Username: <rw_username>
3. This is Password: <rw_password>
4. This is globally unique connection point: <rw_connection_point_name test/cp1>

# Following are colon separated complex TAGs
5. This is connection point for a given VNF with unique member index: <rw_unique_index:rw_connection_point_name 2:test/cp1>
6. This is converting connection point IP address into network address: <rw_connection_point:masklen_network test/cp1:24> 
7. This is converting connection point IP address into boadcast address: <rw_connection_point:masklen_broadcast test/cp1:24>

# Following generated tuple with original connectino point name (Global only)
8. This is not used anywhere: <rw_connection_point_tuple test/cp1>
