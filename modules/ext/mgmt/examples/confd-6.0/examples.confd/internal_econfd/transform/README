Example to show how we can run a transform internally in the ConfD
daemon. The logic of the transform is the same as in the
misc/aaa_transform example, but here implemented in Erlang and using the
"econfd" API to ConfD. The compiled .beam file is placed in the load
path (as specified by /confdConfig/loadPath/dir in confd.conf), and then
loaded by ConfD at startup.

NOTE: To run this example, you need to have an Erlang/OTP installation
with a version that is not newer than the one listed in the
$CONFD_DIR/VERSION file, and the 'erlc' compiler from that installation
in your $PATH.

For more information, read the section "Running application code inside
ConfD" in the "Advanced Topics" chapter of the User Guide.
