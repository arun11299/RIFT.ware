This example shows how we can implement a user-defined type in Erlang.
The "port-type" type has the same syntax and internal representation as
the "portType" type in the misc/user_type example for C. This example
only demonstrates registration of the type callbacks for use internally
in ConfD, but the exact same code can be used for an application running
in its own Erlang VM, in order to provide local string <-> value
translation in that VM.

Since the "types.yang" data model has a leaf "/system/mgmt-port" with a
default value, we need to tell ConfD to load the callback module early
enough in the startup to handle the string -> value translation for
this. This is done by giving the module a name starting with
"ec_user_type" - here we simply used that as the actual name.

The callback functions make use of the possibility to just fail,
i.e. cause a runtime error, to indicate an invalid string or value.
This makes it possible to write very succinct code, but obviously
doesn't allow for giving a user-friendly error message if there is
e.g. a syntax error.

NOTE: To run this example, you need to have an Erlang/OTP installation
with a version that is not newer than the one listed in the
$CONFD_DIR/VERSION file, and the 'erlc' compiler from that installation
in your $PATH.

For more information, read the section "Running application code inside
ConfD" in the "Advanced Topics" chapter of the User Guide.
