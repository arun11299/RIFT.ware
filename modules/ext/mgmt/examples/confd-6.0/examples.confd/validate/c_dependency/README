Simple C Validation Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example is an extended version of the test in
examples.confd/validate/c.  It shows how dependency information can be
specified in the YANG file to optimize the execution time of
validation code.


What the Example does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example uses a configuration of four integers, a, b, c, and d.
The validation point on a_number is the same as in the previous
example, but in the YANG model there is a dependency to b_number
specified.  This means that the validation code will be called only if
a_number or b_number has been modified.

There is also a validation point on c_number, which does not declare
any dependencies.  It will be called for every change in the
database.

For Juniper CLI see line that begins with (J). Not available in ConfD Free.
For Cisco XR CLI see line that begins with (C). 

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing 

        $ make all start

 2. In a different shell, start the CLI and display the configuration

        $ make cli
        ...

        (J) admin@localhost> show configuration mtest | details
	
	    a_number 42;
	    b_number 7;
        c_number 10;
        d_number 20;
	
        (C) localhost# show running-config mtest | details
    
        a_number 42;
        b_number 7;
        c_number 10;
        d_number 20;


 3. Make different configuration changes and watch the printouts from
    the validation code.
