ConfD SNMP Agent Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example suite for the ConfD SNMP agent consists of:

* 1-simple
  This example shows how a given MIB can be implemented by mapping the
  MIB objects to a (hand written) YANG module.

  The mapping between objects in the MIB (scalars and tables) is
  specified as YANG extension statements in the YANG module.

  See also 2-mib-to-yang and 8-emit-mib for alternative ways to implement
  MIBs in ConfD.

* 2-mib-to-yang
  This example shows how a given MIB can be implemented by generating
  a YANG module from the MIB.
  
  The YANG module is generated by using confdc --mib2yang.

  See also 1-simple and 8-emit-mib for alternative ways to implement
  MIBs in ConfD.

* 3-sendtrap
  This example shows how to send notifications from a managed object (MO)
  written in C. 

* 4-snmp-audit
  This example shows how an application can use a notification socket
  to ConfD and receive events as SNMP pdu are processed.

* 5-simple-v3
  The example is the same as the 1-simple example but it
  is extended to use SNMP V3 instead.

* 6-dyncfg
  This example is a combination of the introductory SNMP example,
  1-simple and the ../confdconf/dyncfg example.

* 7-transform
  This example illustrates how ConfD can be used to implement some
  existing SNMP MIBs, and at the same time provide another data model
  for other interfaces such as CLI, NETCONF, and WebUI.

* 8-emit-mib
  This example shows how a MIB can be generated from a given YANG module.

  See also 1-simple and 2-mib-to-yang for alternative ways to implement
  MIBs in ConfD.

* 9-writable-operational
  This example shows how writable operational objects can be
  implemented.  

* 10-context
  This example shows how SNMP contexts can be supported with v1,
  v2c and v3.
