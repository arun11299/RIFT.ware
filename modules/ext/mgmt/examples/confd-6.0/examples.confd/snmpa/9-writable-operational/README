ConfD SNMP Agent Example - Writable operational data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how writable operational data can be implemented.
Writable operational data is data that is writable in the MIB, but
non-config data in the YANG model.  Such data must be marked as
'tailf:writable true' in the YANG model.

In this example, the YANG model is generated from the MIB.  In order
for the mib2yang compiler to translate the read-write objects in the
MIB to writable operational data, a mib annotation file is used.

The example has been made up, and is not something taken from the real
world.

We start with the MIB SIMPLE-MIB.mib, which defines one read-write
scalar variable 'rebootRouter'.  It has the following description:

        When this object is set to '1', the router is
        rebooted.  Setting the variable to '0' results
        results in an 'inconsistentValue' error.  Setting it to any
        other value has no effect.

        When this object is read, the value '0' is returned.

This object is implemented in simple_operational.c.


1. Generate a YANG (.yang) module.

   confdc is used for producing SIMPLE-MIB.yang from SIMPLE-MIB.mib.

   The scalar variable 'rebootRouter' represents writable operational
   data.  Using a MIB annotation file we can tell the compiler to
   mark this in the YANG module.

    confdc --mib2yang SIMPLE-MIB.mib --mib-annotation SIMPLE-MIB.miba \
      > SIMPLE-MIB.yang


2. Compile the YANG module

  The generated YANG module is compiled into SIMPLE-MIB.fxs, with an
  extra YANG annotation file with a callpoint for the implementation of
  the operational data.

    confdc -c -o SIMPLE-MIB.fxs -a SIMPLE-MIB-ann.yang SIMPLE-MIB.yang


3. Compile the MIB

  The MIB needs to be compiled into a '.bin' file in order to be
  loaded into the ConfD SNMP Agent.  For each SNMP object in the MIB
  there must be a mapping into an element in the YANG module.  The
  objects for the SIMPLE-MIB are mapped to elements in the YANG
  module, using tailf:snmp-name attributes.

  In order for confdc to compile the MIB, the file needs to have
  '.mib' as file extension.

  The fxs files which SIMPLE-MIB.fxs depends on must be supplied using -f.


4. Configure the ConfD SNMP Agent
   
  The SNMP Agent is part of the ConfD daemon and can be enabled from
  confd.conf file. Per default the SNMP agent is disabled.  Configure
  the IP address and port of the SNMP agent, and list all the MIBs
  that should be loaded at startup.

  [confd.conf]

  <snmpAgent>
    <enabled>true</enabled>
    <ip>0.0.0.0</ip>
    <port>4000</port>
    <mibs>
      <file>SIMPLE-MIB.bin</file>
    </mibs>
  </snmpAgent>


  Make the system with
      > make all

  Start up the system with 
      > make start


5.  Set the rebootRouter variable using snmpset.

  snmpset -m ./SIMPLE-MIB.mib -c public -v2c localhost:4000 rebootRouter.0 = 1
