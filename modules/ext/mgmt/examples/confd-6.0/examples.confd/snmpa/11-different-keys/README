This example shows how secondary-index can be used for generating a mib
where tables are indexed with objects mapped to the secondary index.

The secondary index must have the name "snmp".

Build the example:

make all

Have a look at the generated MIB SERVER-MIB.mib, and compare the table
srvServerTable with the server list in servers.yang.

Run the example:

make start


Create instances of /servers/server in the CLI. Note that the key is
the name leaf:

make cli-c
config
servers server www1
commit


Look at the resulting table over SNMP:

snmpwalk -m ./SERVERS-MIB.mib -v 2c -c public localhost:4000\
 SERVERS-MIB::srvServerTable

Add an instance to the server list via SNMP:

snmpset -m ./SERVERS-MIB.mib -v 2c -c public localhost:4000\
 SERVERS-MIB::srvServerName.17 = www17\
 SERVERS-MIB::srvServerRowstatus.17 = 4

Delete an instance of the server list via SNMP:

snmpset -m ./SERVERS-MIB.mib -v 2c -c public localhost:4000\
 SERVERS-MIB::srvServerRowstatus.1 = 6



The use of "tailf:secondary-index snmp ..." requires a hook which assigns
(a) unique value(s) to the snmp index leaf(s) when a list instance is
created over a non-snmp interface, such as the CLI.

In this example, the hook will keep a bitmap over used index values, and
use the first (lowest numbered) free index value when a new instance is
created.
