 ConfD SNMP Agent Example - Simple using confd_dyncfg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example is a combination of the introductory SNMP example,
../1-simple and the ../../confdconf/dyncfg example. The purpose of the
example is to show how to configure the ConfD SNMP agent using a
special purpose YANG module, as well as how to hide the SNMP specific
fxs files from the CLI (and other northbound agents).

The three important differences from the examples referred to above are:

  1. All the ConfD provided SNMP YANG modules are compiled using
     "--export snmp", thus hiding them from "normal" view (e.g. from
     the CLI).

  2. The confd_dyncfg.yang is included to be able to configure the ConfD
      SNMP agent via a built-in data-model. The confd_dyncfg.yang is
      compiled using the "--export none" flag, thus hiding confdConfig
      from normal view.

  3. A data model called "system.yang" is included to expose selected
     aspects of the ConfD SNMP agent (and other parts of ConfD) to the
     end-user.

The point of the example is to show an example of how to hide ConfD
configuration, while at the same time exposing selected parts of it in
a way that fits with the system developers data-model.



How to run the example

  1. Start by building "make all"

  2. Start ConfD by issuing "make start"

  3. Start a cli in one terminal "make cli"

  If you have snmpwalk installed, try "make walk". You should see
  something like:

     host% make walk
     snmpwalk -v2c -c public 127.0.0.1:4000
     SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0 = STRING: Tail-f ConfD agent
    ...

  In the CLI you can now:

     admin@host> configure 
     admin@host% set system snmp address port 4444
     admin@host% set system snmp communityString foobar
     admin@host% set system snmp sysDescr "FooBar agent"
     admin@host% commit

  The SNMP agent is now listening to port 4444 instead, the public
  community string as well as the sysDescription string has been
  changed. Issuing a "make walk" in a shell should now look something
  like this:

     host% make walk COMMUNITY=foobar SNMPPORT=4444
     snmpwalk -v2c -c foobar 127.0.0.1:4444
     SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0 = STRING: FooBar agent
     SNMPv2-MIB::sysObjectID.0 = OID: SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.24961
    ...


  Play around with the different settings in system.yang. Also try
  adding more symlinks in the system.yang file (refer to confd_dyncfg.yang
  to see what you can point to).
