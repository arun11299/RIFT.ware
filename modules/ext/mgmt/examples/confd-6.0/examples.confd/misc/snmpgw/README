Example: Using the SNMP gateway
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example illustrates the use of the Confd->SNMP gateway.  A number
of standard MIB modules are translated into YANG modules, which are
then compiled to fxs files.  When ConfD has loaded those fxs files,
accesses to the nodes in them (using e.g. CLI or NETCONF) are
automatically routed to the SNMP agent.  This makes the SNMP MIB
information appear as an integral part of the CLI and NETCONF
interfaces.

A separate SNMP agent must already be running somewhere, implementing
the MIBs IF-MIB and HOST-RESOURCES-MIB.  If not, installing a NET-SNMP
agent (see http://www.net-snmp.org/) ought to be relatively painless.


What the Example does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MIBs we want to make available through ConfD in this example are
IF-MIB and HOST-RESOURCES-MIB.

The first step in the process is to convert the MIB into a YANG
module.  This is done with 'confdc'.  The conversion follows the
standard rules defined in draft-ietf-netmod-smi-yang-05.txt.

    $ confdc --mib2yang-std IF-MIB.mib

IF-MIB does not stand on its own, but depends on a handful of other
MIBs: IANAifType-MIB, SNMPv2-TC, SNMPv2-CONF, SNMPv2-SMI, and
SNMPv2-MIB.  The SNMP MIBs are already converted and delivered with
ConfD, but other MIBs, in this case IANAifType-MIB, must also be
converted.

The HOST-RESOURCES-MIB contains the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
InternationalDisplayString, which is translated by the standard rules
into:

    typedef InternationalDisplayString {
        type binary;
        ...
    }

This means that all objects in HOST-RESOURCES-MIB of this type are
base64 encoded, for example:

    <hrSWRunPath>L3Vzci9saWIvZGNvbmYvZGNvbmYtc2VydmljZQ==</hrSWRunPath>

This is not very user-friendly to display in a user interface, so in
order to instruct ConfD's user interface agents (the CLI and WebUI) to
try to display this as a normal string, we annotate this
TEXTUAL-CONVENTION with a special display hint.  This is done in the
file HOST-RESOURCES-MIB.miba.  The result is that this will look like
this in the CLI:

    hrSWRunPath       /usr/lib/dconf/dconf-service;

In order to use this mib annotation file, it needs to be converted to
YANG, and used when the YANG file is compiled:

    $ confdc --mib2yang-mods --keep-readonly \
        --mib-annotation HOST-RESOURCES-MIB.miba \
        -o HOST-RESOURCES-MIB-ann.yang \
        HOST-RESOURCES-MIB.mib

Once all YANG modules have been produced, they are compiled
into .fxs files using confdc, by passing the flag --snmpgw.

    $ confdc -c --snmpgw IF-MIB.yang

    $ confdc -c --snmpgw ---annotate HOST-RESOURCES-MIB-ann.yang \
	HOST-RESOURCES-MIB.yang


Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files by typing

        $ make all

    This will use the 'confdc' program to translate the MIBs into YANG
    modules, then compile the YANG modules into .fxs files.

 2. Configure SNMP agent access

    Indicate in the <snmpgw> section in confd.conf how
    to access the SNMP agent:

      <snmpgw>
	<enabled>true</enabled>
	<agent>
	  <name>a1</name>
	  <subscriptionId>a1</subscriptionId>
	  <ip>127.0.0.1</ip>
	  <port>161</port>
	  <community>public</community>
	  <version>v2c</version>
	  <timeout>PT2S</timeout>
          <!-- list all modules implemented by this agent -->
	  <module>IF-MIB</module>
	  <module>HOST-RESOURCES-MIB</module>
	</agent>
      </snmpgw>

    If you have NET-SNMP installed, you can check the connectivity
    using:

        $ snmpget -m ./IF-MIB.mib -v 2c -c public localhost ifNumber.0

 3. Start ConfD by typing

        $ make start

 4. Start the CLI with 'make cli'

        > show status IF-MIB

        > show status HOST-RESOURCES-MIB

    SNMP statistics will be returned from the agent.

    For comparison, in case the NET-SNMP tools are installed, the
    command

        $ snmpwalk -v 2c -c public localhost

    does an equivalent access.

 5. Retrieve information over NETCONF

        $ make query-if

        $ make query-host

    This invokes netconf-console-tcp to give us the same information as
    in step 5, but in XML format.
