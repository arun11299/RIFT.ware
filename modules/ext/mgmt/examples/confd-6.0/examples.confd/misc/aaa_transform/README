Example to show how we can transform the fairly complicated
AAA trees which are required by ConfD into a much simpler structure
which could be incorporated somewhere in an application specific
context. This example utilizes the transformation technique described
in the user's guide chapter describing transforms.

In a real application where we really want to hide tailf-aaa.yang and
ietf-netconf-acm.yang from all northbound interfaces, we would typically
use the --export flag when we compile these modules with confdc.
