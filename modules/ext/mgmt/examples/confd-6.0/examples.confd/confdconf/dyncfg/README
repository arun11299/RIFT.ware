Example: Configuring ConfD itself
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how you can use ConfD to configure ConfD itself
using a YANG data model (confd_dyncfg.yang) that is bundled with the ConfD
release.

When you compile and start ConfD with this example you will notice
that there is a confdConfig configurable. Play around with it and see
what you can do. For example, first changing the prompt in edit-mode
in the J-style CLI can be done like this (not supported in ConfD Free):

  > make clean
  > make all
  > make start
  > make cli
  
  > configure
  % set confdConfig cli prompt1 "Command: "
  % commit
  Commit complete
  % exit
  Command: exit

And for C-style CLI:

  # config
  (config)# confdConfig cli cPrompt1 "Command: "
  (config)# commit
  (config)# exit
  Command: exit


Further you can disable the CLI using

  % set confdConfig cli disabled
  % commit

Which drops you back to the shell-prompt, and "make cli" will not help
you here. Try netconf-console to enable it again, like this

  > $CONFD_DIR/bin/netconf-console-tcp enable-cli.xml
