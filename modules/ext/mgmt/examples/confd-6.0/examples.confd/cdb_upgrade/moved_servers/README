CDB upgrade Example using CDB C-API and MAAPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever upgrades get a bit more complicated it might be necessary to
have access to both the old data and the upgraded to complete the
upgrade. This example shows how that is done.


Running the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing

        $ make all start

Now ConfD is running with the first version of the servers.yang
data model. Inspect the current db using "make query" and use the
command line interface to add/delete servers under /servers/server. Or
proceed directly to step 2:

 2. Stop ConfD, build the new version of the .fxs file, and re-start
    ConfD using start-phases. All in one go:

        $ make start-v2

Notice how the database is upgraded to fit with the new schema. Again
use "make query" and "make cli" to inspect.
