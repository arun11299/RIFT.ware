Changing crypto key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrated how to use the built in ConfD crypto types,
and what to do when the encryptions keys in confd.conf are changed.

The application crypto_keys will read all the encrypted strings and
print them in clear-text on stdout when invoked with the "-g" command
line option, or try to write "key=value" pairs received on stdin when
invoked with the "-s" command line option.

Try "make test" and follow what it does to get the idea. Then if you
want to experiment on your own you can:


    make all      - build everything

    make start    - start the confd daemon

    make set      - store some secrets in the database

    make query    - show database contents

    make decrypt  - decrypt the secrets

    make scramble - decrypt, generate new key, re-encrypt secrets  

    make stop     - stop the confd daemon


To create a confd.conf with different encryption keys try

    rm -f confd.conf
    make confd.conf AESKEY=<hextring> AESVECTOR=<hexstring>

Where <hexstring> is a 32 character long string of hex-digits. (This
example only uses the AESCFB128EncryptedString type).


Then, to read the values in clear-text try

    make decrypt
