Example #8: Read-only Instrumentation in C
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how you can instrument C or Python applications to
become ConfD sources of read-only data, typically statistics or
operational information. To do this, the read-only part of the data
provider API is used.

It is a variation of example #5.  The difference is that this example
defines the arp list without any keys.


What the Example does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "arpstat" application is monitoring the operating system ARP
tables by running '/sbin/arp -an' whenever a manager asks for the
current status.  Arpstat is using the data provider API (read-only),
so to ConfD it's acting as an external read-only database, but it's
really drastically simpler than it sounds.

For Juniper CLI see line that begins with (J). Not available in ConfD Free.
For Cisco XR CLI see line that begins with (C). 

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing 

        $ make all start

    or if you want to try the Python example

        $ make all py_start

 2. To see what's happening inside ConfD, optionally tail the ConfD
    log file. Unless you have changed the default configuration for
    this example (see confd.conf) the command would be

        $ tail -f ./confd.log

 3. Start the CLI with 'make cli' and try some commands

        (J) > show status arpentries

        (C) # show arpentries

    Remember to use <TAB> to speed up command entry. Since the data is
    read-only, there really isn't much more you can do here. Type
    'exit' to terminate the CLI.

 4. You can also compose the same queries using NETCONF. Try the
    cmd-*.xml commands in the example:

       netconf-console --get
       netconf-console --get -x /arpentries
