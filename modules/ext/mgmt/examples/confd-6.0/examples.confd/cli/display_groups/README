Example display_groups: exemplify how display groups can be used
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The aim of this example is to demonstrate how display groups can
be used to limit the amount of information shown in the CLI.

The example is based on the 4-java_stats example from intro,
but Java is in no way needed to use the display groups feature.
The data provider could have been written in some other language,
for example, C.

Display groups are used to limit what is displayed below a given
point in the data model. If no display groups are defined when
a show command is given, ie "show <path>" then all nodes below
path are displayed as long as they don't have any display groups
defined, or has the display group "none" defined.

If display groups are defined when entering the show command,
ie, "show <path> <display groups>", then only nodes below <path>
that has any of the display groups in <display groups> defined will
be entered and shown. The display groups specified for the node
indicated by <path> are not taken into account, only the groups
for the children of <path>.

The root node is a special case in the sense that <path> cannot be
empty, ie it is not allowed to write "show <display-groups>".

Build dependencies.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example requires Java CLASSPATH to include log4j and aspectjrt.
The example has been tested against aspectjrt-1.6.5.jar and log4j-1.2.14.jar

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing

        $ make all start

 2. To see what's happening inside ConfD, optionally tail the ConfD
    log file. Unless you have changed the default configuration for
    this example (see confd.conf) the command would be

        $ tail -f ./confd.log

 3. Start the CLI with 'make cli' and try some commands

        > show arp

    Now ping a few of the hosts in your neighborhood and rerun
    the above status command to see that the newly pinged hosts
    are shown in the arp output.

4. Try some more command and completions.

       > show arp ?

   You see arpe and the two display groups details and summary. Try
   summary

       > show arp summary

   Now try details

       > show arp details

   You can also try displaying the data as a straight listing using the
   notab pipe target. Try

       > show arp details | notab

   Or if your screen is too narrow to display the data as a table you can
   still force the data into a table using the 'tab' pipe target.

       > show arp details | tab
