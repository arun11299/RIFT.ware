Example: CLI command implemented in C
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how you can define a CAPI cmdpoint in the 
clispec file, how the command is implemented in C, and how to invoke the
command from the CLI. It also shows how a c-callback can be used
to define a custom mode name in the cisco style CLI.

What the Example does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The actions program is implementing the 'show ctest' CLI command 
using the actions API. The command writes to the CLI and then 
prompts the user whether to proceed or not.

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing 

        $ make all start

 2. To see what's happening inside ConfD, optionally tail the ConfD
    log file. Unless you have changed the default configuration for
    this example (see confd.conf) the command would be

        $ tail -f ./confd.log

 3. Start the CLI with 'make cli' and try the command

        > show ctest from README

    Note how the 'cli-point' action callback in actions.c is executed.

4. Try the command 'show all data' and note how the "show-point"
   callback in actions.c is executed. The data elements are generated
   by the external data provider executed in callpoints.c
