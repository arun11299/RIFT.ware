Example: CLI command implemented in JAVA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how you can define a CAPI cmdpoint in the 
clispec file, how the command is implemented in JAVA, and how to invoke the
command from the CLI.



Build dependencies.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example requires Java CLASSPATH to include log4j and aspectjrt.
The example has been tested against aspectjrt-1.6.5.jar and log4j-1.2.14.jar
See:
http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/
http://logging.apache.org/log4j/


What the Example does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The actions program is implementing the 'show ctest' CLI command 
using the actions API. The command writes to the CLI and then 
prompts the user whether to proceed or not.


Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing 

        $ make all start

 2. To see what's happening inside ConfD, optionally tail the ConfD
    log file. Unless you have changed the default configuration for
    this example (see confd.conf) the command would be

        $ tail -f ./confd.log

 3. Start the CLI with 'make cli' and try the command

        > show ctest from README
