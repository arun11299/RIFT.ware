Example for tables based on Example #4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The aim of this example is to demonstrate how you can easily
customize the show output for tables.

The examples uses Java to implement that data provider. However,
java is not needed to use the table customization shown in 
this example. The data provider could just as well have been
written in some other language, for example, C.


Build dependencies.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example requires Java CLASSPATH to include log4j and aspectjrt.
The example has been tested against aspectjrt-1.6.5.jar and log4j-1.2.14.jar
See:
http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/
http://logging.apache.org/log4j/



What the Example does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrated how we can use a few different table
tweaking options to customize the formatting of tables. 

The application is monitoring the arp tables by running
'/sbin/arp -an' whenever a manager asks for the current status. 

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing 

      $ make all start

 2. To see what's happening inside ConfD, optionally tail the ConfD
    log file. Unless you have changed the default configuration for
    this example (see confd.conf) the command would be

      $ tail -f ./confd.log

 3. Start the CLI with 'make cli' and try some commands

      # show arp

    Now ping a few of the hosts in your neighborhood and rerun
    the above status command to see that the newly pinged hosts 
    are shown in the arp output.

 4. Try some more commands in the CLI. 

      # show arp arpe | select hwaddr
      # show arp arpe | select hwaddr | select published

    

Further Reading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also see some showTemplate in the cli_command example.
Go the cli_command and build using

   $ make all start

And then start the C-style cli using 'make cli-c' and try

   > show SNMPv2-MIB
