Example climods: exemplify how cli modifications can inlined
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The aim of this example is to demonstrate how cli modifications
can be inlined in the YANG files.

Build dependencies.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example requires Java CLASSPATH to include log4j and aspectjrt.
The example has been tested against aspectjrt-1.6.5.jar and log4j-1.2.14.jar
See:
http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/
http://logging.apache.org/log4j/



Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing 

        $ make clean all start

 2. To see what's happening inside ConfD, optionally tail the ConfD
    log file. Unless you have changed the default configuration for
    this example (see confd.conf) the command would be

        $ tail -f ./confd.log

 3. Start the CLI with 'make cli' and try some commands
