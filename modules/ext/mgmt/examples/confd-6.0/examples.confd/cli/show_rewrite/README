Example for tables based on Example #4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The aim of this example is to demonstrate how you can use a
callback to rewrite the show path before invoking the show
command.

The examples makes use of a data provider written in Java. 
However, Java is in no way required to use the rewrite callback.
The data provider could just as well have been written in 
some other language, for examples, C.


Build dependencies.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example requires Java CLASSPATH to include log4j and aspectjrt.
The example has been tested against aspectjrt-1.6.5.jar and log4j-1.2.14.jar
See:
http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/
http://logging.apache.org/log4j/


What the Example does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application is monitoring the arp tables by running
'/sbin/arp -an' whenever a manager asks for the current status. 

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing 

      $ make all start

 2. To see what's happening inside ConfD, optionally tail the ConfD
    log file. Unless you have changed the default configuration for
    this example (see confd.conf) the command would be

      $ tail -f ./confd.log

 3. Start the CLI with 'make cli' and try some commands

      # show arp

    Now ping a few of the hosts in your neighborhood and rerun
    the above status command to see that the newly pinged hosts 
    are shown in the arp output.
