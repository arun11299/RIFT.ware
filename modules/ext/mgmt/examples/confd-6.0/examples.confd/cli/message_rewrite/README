Example for tables based on Example #4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The aim of this example is to demonstrate how you can use a
callback to rewrite various CLI messages.

The 

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing 

      $ make all start

 2. To see what's happening inside ConfD, optionally tail the ConfD
    log file. Unless you have changed the default configuration for
    this example (see confd.conf) the command would be

      $ tail -f ./confd.log

 3. Start the CLI with 'make cli' and try some commands

      # show file xxx

      You will now see the rewritten error message. 

      # show cli xx

      See the custom syntax error message

      # config
      # revert
      
      Enter no, and see the custom abort prefix.
