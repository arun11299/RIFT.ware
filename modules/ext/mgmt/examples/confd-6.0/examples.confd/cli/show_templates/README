Example for show templates based on Example #4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The aim of this example is to demonstrate how you can easily
customize the show output.

Note that Java is needed to run the example but not for using the
show templates. Java is only used for generating data in this 
example and has nothing to do with the actual show templates as
such. The java can easily be replaced by some other data provider
code, written in, for example, C.


Build dependencies.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example requires Java CLASSPATH to include log4j and aspectjrt.
The example has been tested against aspectjrt-1.6.5.jar and log4j-1.2.14.jar
See:
http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/
http://logging.apache.org/log4j/



What the Example does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrated how we can use show templates to 
customize the formatting of tables. 

The application is monitoring the arp tables by running
'/sbin/arp -an' whenever a manager asks for the current status. 


Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing 

      $ make all start

 2. To see what's happening inside ConfD, optionally tail the ConfD
    log file. Unless you have changed the default configuration for
    this example (see confd.conf) the command would be

      $ tail -f ./confd.log

 3. Start the CLI with 'make cli' and try some commands

      # show arp arpe

    Now ping a few of the hosts in your neighborhood and rerun
    the above status command to see that the newly pinged hosts 
    are shown in the arp output.

 4. Try some more CLI commands

      # show arp arpe | select hwaddr
      # show arp arpe | select hwaddr | select published

 5. Configure a default arpe entry to display

      # config
      # default ip 10.0.0.1
      # default ifname ethernet
      # commit
      # exit
      # show arp

Further Reading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also see some showTemplate in the cli_command example.
Go the cli_command and build using

   $ make all start

And then start the C-style cli using 'make cli-c' and try

   > show SNMPv2-MIB

Do also try

   > show arp
   > show arp | show_bignum
   > show arp | show_bignum | humanreadable
   > show arp | humanreadable
