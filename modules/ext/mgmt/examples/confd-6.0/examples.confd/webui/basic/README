Basic Web UI Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example contains a small data model as seen in config.yang. It is
fairly small but it sports a number of YANG constructs, i.e. it models
chassis and interfaces realized as nested list entries, choice
constructs, live operational data stored in both cdb and and served by
an external data provider. It also realizes and action.

To build and start the Web UI:

# make clean all start

If you want to stop the ConfD daemon:

# make stop

Browse and Configure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open up your favorite web browser to the ConfD machine, either http on
port 8008. This is the default http port in the confd.conf file, you
can change them if you want.

# firefox http://localhost:8008

Log in with user name 'admin' and password 'admin'.
