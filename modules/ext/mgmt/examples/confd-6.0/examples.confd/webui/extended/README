Extended Web UI Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example extends the examples.confd/webui/basic/. Please read
examples.confd/webui/basic/README before you proceed with this README
file.

The confd.conf file has been updated to:

* Enable ssl
* Enable audit logging
* Enable Web server access log

The confdc-cdb/aaa_init.xml has been updated to restrict access to
certain areas of the configuration for the oper user. Take a look.
