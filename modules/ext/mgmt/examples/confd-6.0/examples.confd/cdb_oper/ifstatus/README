Updating multi-value CDB operational data atomically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates using CDB for storage of operational data,
with update of a complete XML structure for interface status in one
write operation. This ensures that the status information shown for a
given interface is always internally consistent.

What the example does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 'ifstatus' agent collects interface status from the Linux /proc file
system every 10 seconds, and updates the CDB operational data store for
configured interfaces. It would be possible for the agent to query the
CDB configuration data store to find out which interfaces are actually
present in the config before each update, but in this case a simpler
approach is to just attempt the update: Since the 'status' data
container is a child element of the dynamic 'interface' config element,
CDB will reject the write attempt if the specific instance of the
'interface' element does not exist.

The loopback interface is pre-configured via a CDB init file, and we can
see status for that as well as for additional, manually configured,
interfaces in the CLI, or by doing a NETCONF <get> rpc - see below.

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD and the ifstatus agent by
    typing

        $ make all start

    The ifstatus agent will be running in the foreground.

 2. In another window, look at the interface status for the loopback
    interface in the CLI by typing

        $ make cli
        > show status

 3. Configure another physically existing interface via the CLI and look
    at the status of both by typing (continuing in the above CLI
    session)

        > configure
        % set interfaces interface eth0 address 1.2.3.4 prefix-length 24
        % commit
        (wait at least 10 seconds)
        % run show status 
        % exit
        > exit

  4. Look at the interface status via a NETCONF <get> rpc by typing

        $ make query
