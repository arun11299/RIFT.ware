netconf-server
==============

To run netconf-server you will need additional software:


- OpenSSH
  your version must support SSHv2
  http://www.openssh.com/


The SSH daemon (sshd(8)) included in OpenSSH is required to host
NETCONF SSH server on a machine.

For the server to work, you will also need to specify
the model of a NETCONF server. The default path is
/usr/share/libnetconf/server/model.yin. You can create
a YIN model from the standard YANG format using pyang [1].


SSH Server Settings
-------------------

By default, libnetconf connects to a NETCONF server via port 830.
To allow this connection, you should set SSH server to listen on
port 830 (it listens on port 22 by default) and add an apropriate
rule to your firewall.

On the server side, libnetconf expects that the application is 
invoked as an SSH Subsystem by the SSH server. In case of the OpenSSH
SSH daemon, user has to add the following line to the sshd configuration
(/etc/ssh/sshd_config, sshd_config(5)):

Subsystem netconf <path to the NETCONF agent application>

The default path after installing libnetconf with the examples is
/usr/local/bin/netconf-server.


netconf-client
==============

After successfully setting up the SSH daemon with a NETCONF server,
you can use this client to connect to the server.


netconf-events
==============

This utility can print out events generated by a NETCONF server.
These events are stored in /usr/share/libnetconf/streams. By default,
netconf-server names the file NETCONF.events. To read events from this
file, use "netconf-events NETCONF".
