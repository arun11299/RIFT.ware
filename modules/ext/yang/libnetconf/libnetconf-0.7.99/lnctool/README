ABOUT
================================================================================
Libnetconf transAPI is a framework that will save developers time and let them
focus on configuring and managing their device instead of fighting with NETCONF
protocol.
It allow developer to choose parts of configuration that can be easily configured
as a single block. Based on list of so called 'sensitive paths' generator creates
C code containing single callback function for every 'sensitive path'. Whenever
something changes in configuration file appropriate callback function is called
and should reflect configuration changes to device behavior.

GETTING STARTED
================================================================================
1. Run python script 'generator.py'. Description of parameters follows:
		--name	Name of your module. This is only one mandatory parameter.
		--paths	File with list of sensitive path. One per line.
		--template-dir	Path to directory with template files for generator.
   The directory 'Name' is created with all generated files.
3. Open generated .c file and fill function bodies with code that has to be run
	when configuration change. You can add as many auxiliary function as you need.
	Do NOT modify anything else.
4. Fill body of get_state_data() function so it returns all device state data
	defined in device data model.
5. Run sequence 'autoreconf && ./configure && make'. If the build is succesful
	shared library is generated. You can use it with libnetconf for configuring
	your device.
